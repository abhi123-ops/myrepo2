Hello, my name is mounika, and I have three years of experience in software testing, specializing in manual, automation, and API testing. Throughout my career, I have developed a strong foundation in ensuring the quality of software products by designing and executing test cases, identifying and documenting defects, and collaborating with development teams to resolve issues.

In manual testing, I have honed my skills in functional and regression testing, ensuring that applications meet their requirements and provide a seamless user experience.

In the automation, I have successfully implemented and maintained automated test suites using tools such as Selenium and TestNG. These automated tests have reduced the time required for regression testing and have improved the overall efficiency of the testing process.

 my experience in API testing has equipped me with the knowledge to validate and verify the functionality, performance,   and security of APIs. I have utilized tools like Postman and REST Assured to create and execute comprehensive test cases, ensuring robust and reliable API integrations.

I am passionate about continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends and best practices in software testing. I thrive in collaborative environments and am committed to contributing to the success of the team and the delivery of high-quality software products.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to your organization.




Project: Shop-X Suite
Overview:
The Shop-X Suite is an integrated e-commerce platform designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users. It includes various modules such as user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, payment gateway, and order management.

Role and Responsibilities:
As a Manual Tester on the Shop-X Suite project, my primary responsibilities included:

Requirement Analysis:

Collaborated with business analysts and stakeholders to understand the functional and non-functional requirements.
Participated in requirement review meetings to identify ambiguities and gaps.
Test Planning:

Created detailed test plans outlining the scope, objectives, resources, and timelines for testing activities.
Developed comprehensive test cases and test scripts based on requirement specifications.
Test Execution:

Performed functional, regression, and usability testing across different modules of the application.
Executed test cases manually, documented the results, and reported defects using JIRA.
Conducted cross-browser and cross-device testing to ensure compatibility.
Defect Management:

Logged detailed defect reports with steps to reproduce, severity, priority, and screenshots.
Collaborated with developers to reproduce and resolve defects, and performed retesting and regression testing on fixed issues.
Documentation and Reporting:

Maintained test documentation including test cases, test results, and defect logs.
Prepared and presented test summary reports to the QA lead and project stakeholders.
Challenges Faced:

Ambiguous Requirements:

Challenge: Initially, the requirements were not well-defined, leading to misunderstandings and gaps in test coverage.
Solution: Conducted frequent requirement review sessions with stakeholders and used a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) to ensure all requirements were covered.

Frequent Changes:

Challenge: The project underwent frequent changes in requirements and design, causing disruptions in the testing process.
Solution: Implemented an agile approach to adapt to changes quickly, and maintained a flexible test plan to accommodate modifications.
Cross-Browser Compatibility:

Challenge: Ensuring the application worked seamlessly across different browsers and devices was time-consuming and prone to discrepancies.
Solution: Utilized browser testing tools like BrowserStack to streamline the process and ensure comprehensive coverage.

Integration Issues:

Challenge: Integrating various modules and third-party services such as the payment gateway led to unexpected bugs and compatibility issues.
Solution: Conducted thorough integration testing and worked closely with developers to troubleshoot and resolve issues promptly.

Tight Deadlines:

Challenge: The project had strict deadlines, making it difficult to conduct exhaustive testing within the available time.
Solution: Prioritized critical test cases based on risk and impact, and employed exploratory testing techniques to uncover high-priority defects quickly.
Key Achievements:

Successfully identified and reported critical defects that could have impacted the user experience.
Contributed to the enhancement of test processes and documentation standards, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness.
Collaborated effectively with cross-functional teams to ensure timely delivery of high-quality releases.
